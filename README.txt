v1.02
Just a project I did as an eye-opener to the AutoHotKey language after branching off from python.
A pretty customisable Autoclicker with options to change the keybinding, key pressed and the exit key.
Can go up to about 60 clicks per second according to cpstest.org but it might go faster.
Also has file saving capabilities (Though it will save to your desktop - probably should change that).
Definately not the most efficient way to do things but until I figure out how AHK does for loops I'm gonna have to keep it this way

TODO:
- Be able to have a custom save location
- Create a scrollable GUI
- Be able to add up to 8 or so independant clickers
- Have a GUI that adjusts how far it scrolls dependant on how many clickers there are
- Find a way to hit higher than 60 cps?
